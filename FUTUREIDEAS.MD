Things I want to add:

- Image splicer/tiler -> meaning it will combine multiple images into one by placing them in a grid and resizing them to fit
- Text overlay -> will add text to the images, random text, maybe chinese Hanzi specifically. It can pass the image hash and translate
  that to Hanzi.
  -> Different overlay affects on the images such as the TV Screen effect, or the old film effect.
